# React Native Integration Example

## How to run

Don't forget to create the `.env` file with the variables that has been passed to you.

Assuming that you have Node 14 or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

```
yarn global add expo-cli
```

Then install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Then start expo server:
```
expo start
```

The expo server will start and you can choose which plataform want to run:
```
In the terminal that the server is running:

› Press a │ to open in Android simulator
› Press i │ to open in iOS simulator
› Press w │ to open in web browser
```

## Behavior

As it is a demo, we always pass a random customer-code to have the same behavior every time it is executed.

Remember that the customer-code is the user's identification on the platform.

Feel free to change this implementation.


Enjoy!
